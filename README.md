ChessPos is a decentralized web app where users can play chess with others by putting some matic coins at stake and getting rewards for winning. Chesspos also allows users to engrave their chess game memories on blockchain by minting position-based/Animated gif NFTs.

It solves the big problem of trusting a middleman in every betting scenario by creating a trustless betting system in which you don't need to trust any party. Here, our smart contract plays the role of middle man by collecting staked tokens and distributing them to the winner of the match (code is the law here). 

# Features offered by ChessPos:
* â™Ÿ Stake tokens, play the match and the winner takes it all. 

* ðŸ¤¯ There are more chess positions than the number of atoms present in the observable universe. Due to this type of exclusivity of positions we thought about making the chess positions into NFTs. 

* ðŸ–¼ Users can mint the positions from their previously played games as NFTs. They have the option to change the background color of the NFT. They can also add a short description explaining the position which will be forever engraved on the NFT image. The image will show the wallet address of both the players with the winner, staked amount, and the description.

* â™ž Users can also mint their whole game as animated GIF NFTs which will cycle through the game. It will also the the players wallet address on it.

* ðŸ’¡Our smart contract makes sure every NFT minted on ChessPos is unique in itself by using FEN/PGN strings as unique IDs to identify NFTs. 

* ðŸ’°Our NFTs follow opensea's metadata requirements and are compatible with opensea. So users can easily sell their NFTs on the biggest NFT marketplace(opensea).
